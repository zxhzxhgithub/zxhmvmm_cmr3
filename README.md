## zxhMvMM and MSCMRSeg Challenge
Multivariate Mixture Model for simultaneous registration and segmentation of multi-sequence cardiac MR or multi-source images (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8458220/)
and 
Multi-sequence Cardiac MR Segmentation Challenge (http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/0/mscmrseg19/)

Accurate computing, analysis and modeling of the ventricles and myocardium from medical images is important, especially in the diagnosis and treatment management for patients suffering from myocardial infarction (MI).
MRI is particularly used to provide imaging anatomical and functional information of heart, such as the T2-weighted CMR which images the acute injury and ischemic regions, and the balanced-Steady State Free Precession (bSSFP) cine sequence which captures cardiac motions and presents clear boundaries. Particularly, LGE CMR can enhance the infarcted myocardium, appearing with distinctive brightness compared with the healthy tissues. It is widely used to study the presence, location, and extent of MI in clinical studies. Thus, delineating ventricles and myocardium from LGE CMR images is important.
However, the segmentation is still arduous, particularly due to the pathological myocardium from LGE CMR; but manual delineation is generally time-consuming, tedious and subject to inter- and intra-observer variations.

The Challenge aims at creating an open and fair competition for various research groups to test and validate their methods, particularly for the multi-sequence ventricle and myocardium segmentation.
We provide 45 multi-sequence CMR images from patients who underwent cardiomyopathy. Each patient had been scanned using the three CMR sequences, i.e. the LGE, T2 and bSSFP. The task of this challenge is to segment the ventricles and myocardium from LGE CMR, combing with other two sequences (T2 and bSSFP) from same patients, which can be used to assist the LGE CMR segmentation. This challenge is not only to benchmark various segmentation algorithms, but also to cover the topic of general cardiac image segmentation, registration and modeling.
